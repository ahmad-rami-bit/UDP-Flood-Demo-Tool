## 🧪 Use Cases

- Network stress testing in lab environments
- Demonstrating UDP packet flooding
- Teaching basic socket programming and denial-of-service concepts

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```bash
python UDP-Flood-Demo-Tool.py
```

You’ll be prompted to enter:
